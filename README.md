## 🤦‍♂️ Why another GPT mac app?
Did the world really need another Mac Desktop App?... I'd say so! 

All desktop apps are webviews around ChatGPT, I didn't see a lot of native solutions using the API. So this started as a small project to scrathc my own itch.

## 🔍 What it is now
This is V1, with a focus on getting quick access to GPT on your Mac. Nothing fancy, just handy.

## 🔮 What it could be
A purely native MacOS app, that could switch between OpenAI, Bard, Llama, or any other service out there. 

Image generation, video generation, text, ... OmniPrompt should be our playing ground, and ss a collective we are able to do this 💪

## ✨ Features

## 🏗️ Jobs to be done
- **Token counter**: Display tokens, and when token limit surpassed allowed API call limit (8k), take fewer messages
- **Personas**: Create your own custom prompts, and switch on the fly.
- **Saved messages library**: being able to save specific messages, and viewing them in a library
- **Text to speech**: text to speech to fill in the prompt
- .... your next idea?
